# Cross-Channel Paid Media Performance Dashboard

## Overview

This project unifies advertising performance data from Facebook, Google, and TikTok into a standardized data model to enable cross-channel performance analysis and executive reporting.

The objective was to transform raw multi-platform campaign data into a single, integrated structure and deliver actionable insights through a one-page dashboard.

## Data Sources

- Facebook Ads
- Google Ads
- TikTok Ads

Each platform dataset contained campaign-level metrics including impressions, clicks, spend, and conversions. Google additionally included revenue (conversion value), which was incorporated into efficiency calculations.

## Data Modeling Approach

### 1️. Unified Fact Table
Created:

`FACT_PAID_MEDIA_PERFORMANCE`

- Standardized column structure across platforms
- Normalized naming conventions (ad_set / adgroup → ad_group)
- Handled platform-specific fields using NULL where applicable

### 2️. Derived Metrics View
Created:

`VW_PAID_MEDIA_METRICS`

Calculated performance metrics:

- CTR = Clicks / Impressions  
- CPC = Spend / Clicks  
- CPA = Spend / Conversions  
- ROAS = Revenue / Spend  
- Profit = Revenue - Spend  

Additionally implemented platform-level performance ranking using window functions.
